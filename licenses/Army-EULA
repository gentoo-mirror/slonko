7. USER GENERATED CONTENT

A. General Provisions

"User Generated Content" means any content you make available to other users, the U.S. Army or its affiliates through your use of the Army Software.

You grant U.S. Army and its affiliates the non-exclusive, irrevocable right to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and publicly perform, your User Generated Content, and derivative works of your User Generated Content, in connection with the operation and promotion of the Army Software.

If you provide U.S. Army with any feedback or suggestions about the Army Software, U.S. Army is free to use the feedback or suggestions however it chooses, without any obligation to account to you.

B. Content Uploaded to the Army Software Steam Workshop

The Army Software available on Steam is a "Workshop-Enabled App" as defined by STEAM® SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT and allows you to create User Generated Content using the Army Software, and to submit that User Generated Content (a “Workshop Contribution”) to the Army Software’s Steam Workshop web pages. Workshop Contributions can be viewed by the Steam community, and users are able to interact with and download the Workshop Contribution. In some cases, Workshop Contributions may be considered for incorporation by U.S. Army into the Army Software, other games or other U.S. Army products.

You understand and agree that U.S. Army is not obligated to use, distribute, or continue to distribute copies of any Workshop Contribution to the Army Software’s Steam Workshop and reserves the right, but not the obligation, to restrict or remove Workshop Contributions for any reason.

Workshop Contributions are Subscriptions, and therefore you agree that any Subscriber receiving distribution of your Workshop Contribution will have the same rights to use your Workshop Contribution (and will be subject to the same restrictions) as are set out in this Agreement for any other Subscriptions.
Notwithstanding the license described in this document, U.S. Army will only have the right to modify or create derivative works from your Workshop Contribution in the following cases: (a) U.S. Army may make modifications necessary to make your Contribution compatible with Army Software, and (b) U.S. Army or the applicable developer may make modifications to Workshop Contributions that are accepted for distribution with Army Software or distributed in a manner that allows it to be used in-game, as it deems necessary or desirable to enhance gameplay.
You may, in your sole discretion, choose to remove a Workshop Contribution from the applicable Workshop pages. If you do so, U.S. Army will no longer have the right to use or distribute the Workshop Contribution, except that (a) U.S. Army may continue to exercise these rights for any Workshop Contribution that is accepted for distribution in-game or distributed in a manner that allows it to be used in-game, and (b) your removal will not affect the rights of any Subscriber who has already obtained access to a copy of the Workshop Contribution.
Except where otherwise provided in this license, you agree that U.S. Army’s consideration of your Workshop Contribution is your full compensation, and you are not entitled to any other rights or compensation in connection with the rights granted to U.S. Army and to other Subscribers.

C. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant to U.S. Army that you have sufficient rights in all User Generated Content to grant U.S. Army and other affected parties any license terms specific to the Army Software or its Workshop page. This includes, without limitation, any kind of intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights affected by or included in the User Generated Content. In particular, with respect to Workshop Contributions, you represent and warrant that the Workshop Contribution was originally created by you (or, with respect to a Workshop Contribution to which others contributed besides you, by you and the other contributors, and in such case that you have the right to submit such Workshop Contribution on behalf of those other contributors).

You furthermore represent and warrant that the User Generated Content, your submission of that Content, and your granting of rights in that Content does not violate any applicable contract, law or regulation.
